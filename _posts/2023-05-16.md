##My First Classifier!

I just finished writing my first classifier in a Jupyter Notebook using fastai based on the example provided in the 'Is it a bird?' lesson. It was surprisingly simple! My task was to adapt the classifer so that it could identify 10 differnet animals. 

I chose the following animals:
1. cat
2. eagle
3. turtle
4. cow
5. horse
6. anteater
7. shark
8. penguin
9. crocodile
10. dragonfly

{% include info.html text="I selected these animals as they are distinct from each other to make classification easier." %}
