# Introduction to fastai

## Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Train a model to find out in seconds!
The first lesson on fastai presented by Jeremy Howard kicked off with training an AI model to perform a task that was considered inconcievable just 8 years ago, as described by an [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1425/) comic from 2015. 

This process consisted of:
1. Collecting samples of photographs from duck duck go.
2. Verifying the images downloaded correctly.
3. Training a model using `DataLoaders`.
4. Adapting the model using `fine_tune()`.
5. Using the model to classify differnet pictures.

It was cool to see how a model can be generated so easily by scouring duckduckgo.com for desired images.

The most interesting part of this process to me was using the `DataBlock` feature of fastai to **quickly** generate *training* and *validation* sets.

    dls = DataBlock(
        blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),
        get_items=get_image_files, 
        splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),
        get_y=parent_label,
        item_tfms=[Resize(192, method='squish')]
    ).dataloaders(path, bs=32)

Everything that fastai needs to know about the model it is constructing is presented in this DataBlock.
- ImageBlock specifies the input type of the model and categoryblock indicates the output type. 
- Get image files is a list of files that the model will use for inputs.
- Splitter specifies the validation data set for the model - randomly set aside 20% of the data in this case.
- How do we know the correct label of an image? From the parent label
- Item transforms - resize each image to being 192 x 192 by squishing the image.




## Things I'm Looking forward to Exploring
> fastai is not just for computer vision... - Jeremy Howard


There are so many fascinating use cases for fastai mentioned in this lesson. Segmentation, tabular analysis, audio classification, etc.
I can't wait to play around with some more models.
