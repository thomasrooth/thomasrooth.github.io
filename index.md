I am an undergraduate student in my last semester at UQ. I am a mechatronics major, but I am fascinated by the world of computer vision and AI.
I have been inspired by [Jeremy Howard](https://au.linkedin.com/in/howardjeremy) to learn all I can about the developing field of fastai.

This blog is a place where I will share my thoughts and interests as I progress through the fastai lessons by Jeremy Howard.
